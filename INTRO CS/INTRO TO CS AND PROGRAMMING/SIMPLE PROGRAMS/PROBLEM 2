#Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months.
#By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.
#Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made).
#The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. 
#Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative using this payment scheme, which is okay.
