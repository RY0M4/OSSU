# In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
# The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive).
# The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!

low = 0
high = 100

print('Please think of a number between 0 and 100!')

while True:
    guess=(low+high)//2
    print('Is your secret number ' + str(guess) + '?')
    a=input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. Your input: ")
    if a == 'h':
        high = guess
    elif a == 'l':
        low = guess
    elif a == 'c':
