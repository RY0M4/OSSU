#Now you will implement the function hangman, which takes one parameter - the secretWord the user is to guess. 
#This starts up an interactive game of Hangman between the user and the computer.
#Be sure you take advantage of the three helper functions, isWordGuessed, getGuessedWord, and getAvailableLetters, that you've defined in the previous part.
