; Design a function that pluralizes a given word.
; For simplicity you may assume that just adding s is enough to pluralize a word.

; Signature, purpose and stub.
; Define examples, wrap each in check-expect.
; Template and inventory.
; Code the function body.
; Test and debug until correct

; signature: singular word ---> plural word
; purpose: to return the plural of a word
; stub: (define (pluralize word)
;         (... add letter s))

(check-expect (pluralize "cat") "cats")
(check-expect (pluralize "dog") "dogs")
(check-expect (pluralize "bird") "birds")

(define (pluralize word)
  (string-append word "s"))

(pluralize "turtle")
